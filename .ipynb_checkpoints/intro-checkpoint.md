This web page is a supplement to Metro Vancouver's annual *Water Supply Areas - Climate Summary* report. It provides a series of plots, maps, and images summarizing the weather conditions in Metro Vancouver's water supply areas in 2024. This is your opportunity to dig deeper into the data, and to see how this year stacked up against recent years and historical normals.
